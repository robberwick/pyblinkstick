This module provides the BlinkStickNano class for controlling BlinkStick Nano USB LED
devices. The BlinkStick Nano is a simple USB-powered LED controller featuring a single
RGB LED that can be programmatically controlled through a USB interface.

Hardware Features:
- Single RGB LED with full color spectrum support
- USB HID interface for reliable communication
- Plug-and-play USB operation
- Compact form factor

Software Capabilities:
- Direct LED color control
- Simple command interface
- Thread-safe operation
- Animation system integration
- Extensible design for custom implementations

Example usage:
    from blinkstick.clients.blinkstick_nano import BlinkStickNano

    # Initialize device
    nano = BlinkStickNano()

    # Basic control
    nano.set_color(red=255, green=0, blue=0)  # Set to red
    nano.turn_off()  # Turn off the LED

    Represents a BlinkStick Nano device and provides functionality to control it.

    The BlinkStickNano class inherits from BlinkStickClientBase and is specifically
    designed for interacting with the BlinkStick Nano hardware. It serves as a client
    to send commands and control the device. This class can be further extended or
    used to implement device-specific functionality.
