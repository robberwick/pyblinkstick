"""
BlinkStick Strip control implementation.

This module provides the BlinkStickStrip class for interfacing with BlinkStick Strip
LED devices. It inherits core functionality from BlinkStickClientBase and serves as
a foundation for strip-specific features and controls.

Classes:
    BlinkStickStrip: Implementation class for controlling BlinkStick Strip LED devices.

Example:
    Basic usage:

    >>> from blinkstick.clients.blinkstick_strip import BlinkStickStrip
    >>> strip = BlinkStickStrip()
    >>> strip.turn_on()
    >>> strip.set_color(red=255, green=0, blue=0)  # Set strip to red
    >>> strip.turn_off()

Note:
    This implementation currently provides base LED strip functionality through
    inheritance. Future versions may add strip-specific features and optimizations.
